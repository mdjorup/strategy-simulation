Trading Idea: Buy the market, but slightly more optimally

The strategy goes as follows:
- Start with 0$ in a simulated account
- Every d trading days, add x dollars to the account
- When the money is added, do the following things:
    - Parameters: a dictionary with the allocation of funds {1: 0.5, .95: 0.25, .90: 0.25 }
    - Make market and limit orders based on the set allocation of funds
    - These limit orders expire in p trading periods
- Every day, check if any of the available limit orders can be bought or sold
- keep track of account balance over time
- Base case is {1: 1} --> goal is to beat this number

What we need:
- Order object
    - price
    - shares
    - expiration
- Account object
    - shares owned
    - amount invested
    - execute order function
- function to load market data
